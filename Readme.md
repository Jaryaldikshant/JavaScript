# JavaScript Execution Context

Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**.

## **What is an Execution Context?**
An **Execution Context** is like a **Big Box** that has two main components:

1. **Memory Component** (also called **Variable Environment**)
   - This stores **variables and functions** as key-value pairs.
   
2. **Code Component** (also called **Thread of Execution**)
   - This is where JavaScript **executes code line by line**.

JavaScript is a **synchronous single-threaded language**, meaning it executes one command at a time in a specific order.

---

## **What Happens When We Run a JavaScript Program?**
Whenever a JavaScript program runs, an **Execution Context is created**, consisting of two phases:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Creation Phase (Variable Environment)**
   - All variables are initially assigned `undefined`.
   - Functions are stored in memory as complete definitions.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Execution Phase (Thread of Execution)**
   - `undefined` values are replaced with actual values.
   - Functions are executed when invoked, creating **new Execution Contexts**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution Example**
```javascript
var n = 2;

function square(num) {
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}

var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

### **Step 1: Global Execution Context (GEC)**
When the script starts, the **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created with two phases:

#### **Memory Creation Phase (Variable Environment)**
- `n` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `square` ‚Üí stores the function definition
- `square2` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `square4` ‚Üí `undefined`

#### **Code Execution Phase (Thread of Execution)**
- `n = 2` ‚úÖ (value is updated)
- `square` function remains unchanged ‚úÖ (function stays in memory)
- `square2 = square(n);` **(function invocation - new Execution Context is created)**

---

### **Step 2: Function Execution Context (FEC) for `square(n)`**
Since `square(n)` is invoked, a **new Execution Context** is created.

#### **Memory Creation Phase (Variable Environment)**
- `num` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `ans` ‚Üí `undefined`

#### **Code Execution Phase (Thread of Execution)**
- `num = 2` ‚úÖ
- `ans = num * num` ‚Üí `ans = 2 * 2 = 4` ‚úÖ
- `return ans` ‚Üí returns `4` ‚úÖ
- `square2` is updated with `4` ‚úÖ
- **Function Execution Context is removed from the Call Stack** ‚ùå

Back to **Global Execution Context (GEC)**, continuing execution at `square4 = square(4);`

---

### **Step 3: Function Execution Context (FEC) for `square(4)`**
A new **Function Execution Context** is created again.

#### **Memory Creation Phase (Variable Environment)**
- `num` ‚Üí `undefined`
- `ans` ‚Üí `undefined`

#### **Code Execution Phase (Thread of Execution)**
- `num = 4` ‚úÖ
- `ans = num * num` ‚Üí `ans = 4 * 4 = 16` ‚úÖ
- `return ans` ‚Üí returns `16` ‚úÖ
- `square4` is updated with `16` ‚úÖ
- **Function Execution Context is removed from the Call Stack** ‚ùå

---

## **Summary**
‚úî **Execution Context is created in two phases:**  
   - **Memory Creation Phase** (variables & functions stored in memory)  
   - **Code Execution Phase** (line-by-line execution happens)  

‚úî **Function calls create a new Execution Context.**  
‚úî **Each function execution has its own memory space (Variable Environment).**  
‚úî **Once a function returns a value, its Execution Context is deleted from the Call Stack.**

### Shortest function in JavaScript is the empty file of JS

## Code Breakdown:

```javascript
var a = 10;

function b() {
    var x = 1100;
}
```

### Global Scope:
- The variable `a` is declared using `var`, so it is hoisted to the global execution context.
- In the browser, the global execution context is associated with the `window` object, meaning you can access `a` as `window.a`.

### Function Scope:
- The function `b` is also in the global scope, meaning it is accessible as `window.b`.
- However, the variable `x` inside `b()` is not global. It is function-scoped and only exists while `b` is executing.

### Checking in the Browser Console:
You can verify this by running:

```javascript
console.log(window.a); // 10
console.log(window.b); // function b() { var x = 1100; }
console.log(window.x); // undefined (because x is not in the global scope)
```

# Hoisting in JavaScript

## üöÄ What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution. However, **only declarations are hoisted, not initializations**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hoisting with `var`, `let`, and `const`

```javascript
console.log(a);  // ‚ùå ReferenceError
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 10

const x = 1000;
console.log(x); // ‚úÖ 1000

var b = 30;
console.log(b); // ‚úÖ 30
```

### üîπ Key Points:
- **`var`** is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- **`let` and `const`** are hoisted but **not initialized**, causing a **ReferenceError** if accessed before declaration.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
TDZ is the time between a `let` or `const` variable's hoisting and its initialization.

```javascript
console.log(a);  // ‚ùå ReferenceError (TDZ)
let a = 10;  // TDZ ends here
console.log(a);  // ‚úÖ 10
```

- Accessing a variable in **TDZ throws a ReferenceError**.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `var` vs `let` & `const` in Global Scope

```javascript
console.log(window.b); // ‚úÖ 30
console.log(window.a); // ‚ùå undefined
```

- **`var` attaches to `window`** in browsers.
- **`let` and `const` are stored separately** in a different memory space.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ `const` is More Strict Than `let`

```javascript
let c; // ‚úÖ Allowed, can be initialized later
c = 20;

const d; // ‚ùå SyntaxError: Must be initialized
```

- **`let` allows declaration without initialization**.
- **`const` must be initialized at declaration**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Errors
| **Error Type**  | **Cause** |
|---------------|------------|
| **SyntaxError** | Incorrect syntax (e.g., `const d;`). |
| **TypeError** | Changing a `const` variable. |
| **ReferenceError** | Accessing a variable before declaration (TDZ). |

---

##  In Short

‚úÖ **Hoisting:** `var` is initialized as `undefined`, `let` and `const` are not.

---

‚úÖ **TDZ:** Accessing `let` or `const` before initialization causes a **ReferenceError**.

---

‚úÖ **Global Scope:** `var` is in `window`, `let` & `const` are stored separately.

---

‚úÖ **Errors:** SyntaxError, TypeError, ReferenceError.

# JavaScript Blocks and Scope

##  What is a Block?
A **block** in JavaScript is defined by `{}` and is also known as a **compound statement**. It groups multiple JavaScript statements where a **single statement is expected**.

```javascript
if (true) {  // JavaScript expects a single statement
    var a = 10;
}
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Block Scope

```javascript
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    
    console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 10
    console.log(b); // ‚úÖ 20
    console.log(c); // ‚úÖ 30
}

console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 10 (because `var` is global)
console.log(b); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
console.log(c); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
```

### üîπ Key Points:
- **`let` and `const` are block-scoped** (only accessible inside the block).
- **`var` is function-scoped** (accessible outside the block if not inside a function).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shadowing
When a **variable inside a block has the same name** as one outside, the inner variable **shadows** the outer variable.

```javascript
var a = 100;
{
    var a = 67;  // Shadows the outer `a`
    let b = 45;
    const c = 98;
    console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 67
    console.log(b); // ‚úÖ 45
    console.log(c); // ‚úÖ 98
}
console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 67 (var is updated globally)
```

- **With `var`, the outer variable is also modified.**
- **With `let` and `const`, shadowing does not affect the outer variable.**

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Illegal Shadowing
Using `let` outside and `var` inside the block with the same name is **illegal**.

```javascript
let x = 20;
{
    var x = 30;  // ‚ùå SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
}
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lexical Scope & Environment
Each block has its **own lexical environment**, which includes:
- **Local memory (variables declared inside the block).**
- **Reference to the lexical environment of its parent.**

```javascript
const a = 20;
{
    const a = 10;
    {
        const a = 33;
        console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 33 (innermost scope has priority)
    }
}
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Arrow Functions üöÄ
Arrow functions are a shorthand way to write functions in JavaScript.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3)); // ‚úÖ 8
```

# Understanding Closures in JavaScript

## What is a Closure?
A **closure** is a function that remembers the variables from its **lexical scope**, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

In simple terms, **a closure allows a function to "remember" the environment in which it was created**.

## Explanation with Examples

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Closure Example
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    var message = "Hello, I am a closure!";
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(message);
    }
    
    return innerFunction;
}

const myFunc = outerFunction();
myFunc(); // Output: Hello, I am a closure!
```
üîπ Even though `outerFunction` has finished execution, `innerFunction` still **remembers** the `message` variable.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ setTimeout and Closure Issue
```javascript
function x() {
    var i = 10;
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, 3000);
    console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
}
x();
```
**Output:**
```
Namaste JavaScript
10 (after 3 seconds)
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**
- `console.log("Namaste JavaScript")` runs immediately.
- `setTimeout` registers a function that logs `i` after 3 seconds.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loop with `var` (Closure Issue)
```javascript
function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
    console.log("Hello");
}
x();
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Hello
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Actual Output:**
```
Hello
9 (after 1 sec)
9 (after 2 sec)
9 (after 3 sec)
9 (after 4 sec)
9 (after 5 sec)
9 (after 6 sec)
9 (after 7 sec)
9 (after 8 sec)
```
‚ùå **Issue:**
- `var` is **function-scoped**, meaning all callbacks inside `setTimeout` share the same `i`, which becomes `9` after the loop finishes.

‚úÖ **Fix 1: Using `let` (Block Scope)**
```javascript
function x() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
    console.log("Dikshant");
}
x();
```
**Correct Output:**
```
Dikshant
1 (after 1 sec)
2 (after 2 sec)
3 (after 3 sec)
4 (after 4 sec)
```
‚úÖ **Why does this work?**
- `let` is **block-scoped**, so a new `i` is created for each iteration.

‚úÖ **Fix 2: Using a Closure to Store `i`**
```javascript
function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        function close(x) {
            setTimeout(function () {
                console.log(x);
            }, x * 1000);
        }
        close(i);
    }
    console.log("Dikshant");
}
x();
```
**Correct Output:**
```
Dikshant
1 (after 1 sec)
2 (after 2 sec)
3 (after 3 sec)
4 (after 4 sec)
```
‚úÖ **Why does this work?**
- We pass `i` to a function (`close`), creating a **new scope** with `x` storing the correct value.

---

## Summary
‚úî **Closures allow functions to remember variables even after execution ends.**

‚úî Used for **private variables, custom functions, and state management.**

‚úî **Common mistakes:** Using `var` inside loops, memory leaks, and deep nesting.

‚úî **Fix issues** by using `let` or wrapping values in another function (closure).

**Closures are powerful in JavaScript for handling async operations, callbacks, and encapsulating data!**
