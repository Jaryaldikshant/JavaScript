// Undefined : a special keyword or a plceholder that kept inside the variable  and takes up the memory until the actual value is assigned, Here is 'a'

// Not defined : it is never declared in the code, nor exist in the memory, Here is 'x'


// Also, JavaScript is the loosely/weakly typed language means if we assingn with the datatype later we can add any datatype in it

var a;

console.log(a);
a = "Hello";
console.log(a);


a = undefined;  // not a good practice
